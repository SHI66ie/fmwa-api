## 🌐 **How It Works:**

### **For Department Pages:**
```php
<?php
$page_title = "Department Name - FMWA";
include '../components/header.php';
?>
<!-- Department content here -->
<?php include '../components/footer.php'; ?>
```

### **For Main Site Pages:**
```php
<?php
$page_title = "Page Title - FMWA";
include 'components/head.php';
include 'components/navigation.php';
?>
<!-- Page content here -->
<?php include 'components/main-footer.php'; ?>
```

## 🔗 **All URLs Work:**

### **PHP Versions (Primary):**
- `https://womenaffairs.gov.ng/departments/child-development.php`
- `https://womenaffairs.gov.ng/departments/women-development.php`
- etc.

### **HTML Versions (Redirect to PHP):**
- `https://womenaffairs.gov.ng/departments/child-development.html` → redirects to `.php`
- `https://womenaffairs.gov.ng/departments/women-development.html` → redirects to `.php`
- etc.
