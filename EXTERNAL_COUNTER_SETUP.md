## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

Since you already pushed to GitHub:

1. **Check cPanel Git Deployment:**
   - Login to cPanel
   - Go to "Git Version Control"
   - It should auto-pull the latest changes

2. **If auto-deploy worked:**
   - Visit: http://www.womenaffairs.gov.ng
   - Visitor counter should appear immediately
   - No more 404 errors!

### Option 2: Manual Upload (If Auto-Deploy Fails)

Only need to upload **ONE file**:

1. Login to cPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html/js/`
4. Upload the updated file:
   - `js/visitor-counter.js`
5. Overwrite the existing file
6. Done! ✅

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Locally First:

1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Check browser console (F12)
3. Should see NO errors
4. Counter appears in bottom-right corner
5. Shows current visitor count

### Test on Production:

1. Visit: http://www.womenaffairs.gov.ng
2. Counter should appear immediately
3. No 404 errors in console
4. Count increments on new visits

## 📊 How Session Tracking Works

```javascript
// First visit
User visits → Increment count → Save to sessionStorage → Display count

// Page refresh (same session)
User refreshes → Check sessionStorage → Don't increment → Display count

// New session (new browser/incognito)
User visits → No sessionStorage → Increment count → Display count
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Change the Counter Key:

Edit `js/visitor-counter.js`:

```javascript
this.namespace = 'womenaffairs.gov.ng';  // Your domain
this.key = 'website-visitors';           // Change this to anything
```

### Reset the Counter:

Visit this URL to reset to 0:
```
https://api.countapi.xyz/set/womenaffairs.gov.ng/website-visitors?value=0
```

### Set a Specific Value:

```
https://api.countapi.xyz/set/womenaffairs.gov.ng/website-visitors?value=1000
```
